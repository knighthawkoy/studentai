Overview:
This Python script uses Flask, a popular web framework, to create a simple web application with endpoints for registering users, logging in, viewing and updating profiles, and logging out. It uses an SQLite database to store user data, including usernames, emails, passwords, and session tokens.

Key Components:
Flask App: The app object is an instance of the Flask class and serves as the central object for the web application.
SQLite Database: A file-based database used to store users' data. The location of the database is set by the DATABASE variable.
Database Connection: The function get_db_connection() establishes a connection to the SQLite database file.
Functions and Endpoints:
Database Initialization (init_db): Creates a new table named "users" if it doesn't already exist when the application starts up.

User Registration (/register endpoint): This endpoint allows new users to register by providing a username, email, and password via a POST request.

User Login (/login endpoint): Users can log in using their username and password. Upon successful login, a unique session token is generated and returned.

User Profile (/profile endpoint): Allows retrieval of the user's profile information based on the provided session token.

Update Profile (/update-profile endpoint): Enables the user to update their email address. Requires the user's session token for authentication.

User Logout (/logout endpoint): Invalidates the user's session token, effectively logging them out of the application.

Running the Application:
At the end of the script, there is a check to see if the script is being run directly (not imported). If so, the web application is started with app.run, listening on all interfaces (host='0.0.0.0') at port 5000, with debug mode enabled.

Security Notes:
The code has comments mentioning that in a real-world setting, passwords should be hashed before being stored and compared. The use of plain text passwords, as shown in this example, is highly insecure.

Usage:
To use this system, you would send HTTP requests to the defined endpoints with the appropriate method (POST for registering and logging in, GET for the user profile and logout, and PATCH for updating the profile).

Note that this explanation assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

RESTful API design
HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PATCH)
Basic understanding of SQL and databases
Web server operation and request handling
